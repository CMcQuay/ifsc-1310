    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially web development based on the philosophy that "content is king". It focuses on making the content of 
    a website accessible to all browsers, or at least as many as possible, as opposed to graceful degradation only focusing on building websites for the most advanced browsers.
    This makes for less alienation of viewers and makes the modern web a better place for everyone. To put it metaphorically, the HTML that embodies
    the content of a website is the thick core of that site, the way it is presented with CSS is the next thickest layer surrounding the former, and the scripting of all of it
    is the least thick layer of the three surrounding both of the former. The thickness of these layers is representative of their importance in the
    Progressive Enhancement model, with content obviously being the most important. This means that content being viewable and functional is usually
    accessible to all users, while users of more advanced software (ie: browsers) are still able to get additional enhancements out of the website.
    This is a better methodology than graceful degradation because it means everyone can access the content of a website easily, not just those with 
    advanced software, while those with advanced software can still enjoy advanced versions of the same content that are granted by said advanced software.

    <h2>Dragon Project - Revised Reflection</h2>
    <p>After completing the SpaceX Dragon Project for the first time, I decided to show it to my mother and father while I stayed with them during Thanksgiving break. While
    they were very impressed with the work and happy to see that I was actually learning stuff after all, I asked them to give some constructive criticism on the work.
    My parents admittedly do not know much about web development, but most of their criticisms could be boiled down to simple common sense anyway. The general consensus
    between them and myself was that a few parts of my visuals were lacking or felt out of place or unfinished. For example, while I had chose my own color scheme from Adobe Color, 
    it did not mix well with the default white page color and meant some parts looked out of place while others were harder to see than they should be. I addressed this by tweaking 
    the color scheme slightly and turning the page backgrounds black. I have always been more of a dark theme person anyway, and this meant my project had become an easier - and sexier - viewing experience.</p>
    <p>Other visual issues have been addressed as well. The Dragon logo used near the top of each page was way too large before, so I fixed this by replacing the image with a smaller and different, but similar, one 
    that fits in more with the altered color scheme. Although it isn't CSS related, a table on the history page had a seemingly incomplete row, and this has been fixed as well. All in all, my Dragon project is looking its sharpest, 
    so I would say the CSS is the part I did my best work on. I did fine on the HTML side of things as well, but it felt finicky compared to CSS as I could never get things to appear exactly as I wanted them to, even if they still 
    looked fine. However, I did not do as well with javascript, as I did not utilize it as much as I probably should have, 
    probably because I did not see it as being as much of a priority as HTML and CSS. If I had to start over, I would definitely have a lot of fun with javascript, as I can now see some parts of this project in particular where it could 
    be used effectively.</p>
    <p>Overall, the amount of new information and techniques in this class nearly overwhelmed me. Previously, I had little experience with CSS and no experience with javascript, opting to use C# in its stead thanks to Blazor. However, 
    I am happy to at least be able to say I learned something from this class, and having something to show for it is a very nice bonus. I look forward to potentially having more classes like this in the future due to being a computer science 
    major, and I sure wouldn't mind being taught by the same teacher again either.</p>
