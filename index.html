    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially web development based on the philosophy that "content is king". It focuses on making the content of 
    a website accessible to all browsers, or at least as many as possible, as opposed to graceful degradation only focusing on building websites for the most advanced browsers.
    This makes for less alienation of viewers and makes the modern web a better place for everyone. To put it metaphorically, the HTML that embodies
    the content of a website is the thick core of that site, the way it is presented with CSS is the next thickest layer surrounding the former, and the scripting of all of it
    is the least thick layer of the three surrounding both of the former. The thickness of these layers is representative of their importance in the
    Progressive Enhancement model, with content obviously being the most important. This means that content being viewable and functional is usually
    accessible to all users, while users of more advanced software (ie: browsers) are still able to get additional enhancements out of the website.
    This is a better methodology than graceful degradation because it means everyone can access the content of a website easily, not just those with 
    advanced software, while those with advanced software can still enjoy advanced versions of the same content that are granted by said advanced software.</p>
